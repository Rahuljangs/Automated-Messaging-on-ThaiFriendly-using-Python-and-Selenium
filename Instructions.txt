This block of code initializes a Chrome browser session using Selenium WebDriver. It loads the ThaiFriendly website and defines the message that will be sent to profiles.

**Instructions:**
1. Run this code block to set up the browser session and define the message.
2. Ensure that the Chrome browser is installed and the WebDriver for Chrome is compatible with your browser version.
3. Replace the Chrome profile directory path with your own directory path where your Chrome user profile data is stored.

**Block 2: Scraping Profile Links**

In this block, the script iterates through the search results pages on ThaiFriendly, scrapes the profile links, and stores them in a list.

**Instructions:**
1. Execute this code block to scrape profile links from the ThaiFriendly website.
2. Ensure that you are logged in to your ThaiFriendly account before running this block to access profile links.

**Block 3: Saving Profile Links to CSV**

This block saves all scraped profile links to a CSV file for future reference.

**Instructions:**
1. Run this block of code to save all scraped profile links to a CSV file.
2. The CSV file will be named 'All_profiles.csv' and will be created in the current directory.

**Block 4: Loading Existing Profiles from CSV**

The script loads existing profiles from a CSV file named 'Existing_profiles.csv' to avoid sending duplicate messages to the same profiles.

**Instructions:**
1. Execute this code block to load existing profiles from the CSV file.
2. Make sure you have the 'Existing_profiles.csv' file in the same directory as your Python script.

**Block 5: Sending Messages and Updating Records**

This block sends messages to profiles whose links were scraped earlier. It also updates the list of passed profiles and checks if the profile's last activity was more than a month ago.

**Instructions:**
1. Run this code block to send messages to profiles and update records.
2. Ensure that the Chrome browser remains open and active while the script is running.
3. The script will open each profile link, send a message, and update the record accordingly.

**Block 6: Saving Updated Profile Records**

After sending messages, this block updates the profile records with newly sent messages and saves them to the CSV file.

**Instructions:**
1. Execute this code block to update profile records and save them to a CSV file.
2. The CSV file 'Existing_profiles.csv' will be overwritten with the updated profile records.

Follow these instructions sequentially to automate messaging on ThaiFriendly. Ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites and follow the steps carefully for successful execution of the script.
